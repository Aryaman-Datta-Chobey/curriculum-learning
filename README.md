## Curriculum Learning Experiments

Setting up:

1. Clone this repository
2. Unzip the files in data/preprocessed

#### LSTM reviewer model creation

 **Step1**: Data for LSTM training loop is generated by  Rev_lstm_creation.py and saved to data/lstm_reviewers : 
1. Reads data from unzipped folders in data/preprocessed 
2.  Trains from scratch a BPE tokenizer on the babyLM train set  and locally saves it as a tokenizer object and outputs the tokenizerâ€™s vocab file (saved as BPEvocab).
3.  Tokenizes test and validation sets and splits the  train set into 5 tokenized metasets which are all saved for  training LSTM reviewer models.
4.  Each training sentence is labelled by a sentID for tracking and debugging
**Step2** Migrate data generated in step1 to the azureVM folder. Run the the TrainLSTMS.ipynb to train 5 LSTM reviewer models with early stopping (the other python scripts in the folder currently use scripts from the[ neural complexity repository](https://github.com/vansky/neural-complexity))
#### LSTM reviewer model sentence scoring

**Step3**Run the ReviewMetaSets.ipynb to generate surprisals for each training example in the trainset. (toDO , adding Rscript and documentation for sentence surprisal averaging)
#### Curriculum Creation (TO DO)

Create_curriculum.py and Util.py: 
Utility functions for scripts associated with curriculum creation in the repository. Most importantly implements  function for creating  root-p curriculums as introduced by Platanios et al (2019)
Possible issue: All code in utils.py appears to be included in create_curriculum.py ,may need to refactor one file for future use  and deprecate the other?

#### Model Training (TODO)
